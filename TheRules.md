# The Rules

Points will be deducted for breaking the rules!

Multiple breaks will result in DISQUALIFICATION!

### TDD

You must follow Red/Green/Refactor
 - Each step is mandatory every cycle.  Including refactor!

You must follow Uncle Bobâ€™s Three Rules of TDD, e.g.
 - No code without a failing test
 - Only as much code as needed to make the test pass

### Hacking

No testing
- You can run the program *once per use case implemented* to check that use case.

No static analysis
- Compiling is OK
